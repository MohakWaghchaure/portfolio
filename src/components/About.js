                    I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers Business School. Previously, I have worked as a Frontend Developer in various organizations. I bring three years of frontend and applications development experience, adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, animation libraries, familiar with the design tools like Photoshop, Figma, and Adobe XD. Proficient in the React and Node stack, I've worked with various CMS technologies, including Sitefinity, Drupal, and AEM. My role extends beyond tech, encompassing client interactions, site visits, and a successful track record in both team and solo projects. Eager to embrace new technologies, I excel in understanding motivations, fostering consensus, and achieving results.
